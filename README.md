# Flutter Expense Tracker

A simple **Flutter Expense Tracker** application built to practice handling user input and dynamically updating the UI.  
Users can add expenses by entering details, and the app displays them in a clean and organized list.

This project is part of my Flutter learning journey and focuses on form handling, state updates, and basic app structure.
